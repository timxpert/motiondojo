## Users

Nigerian motion designers, aspiring creatives and international creatives, most of them on smartphones. Many animate on their phones in Alight Motion. They arrive wanting to know what Motion Dojo is, whether they belong there, and how to join.

## Product Purpose

The main brand and community website for Motion Dojo. It is not a course sales page. It should make visitors feel they belong, explain the ecosystem in plain words, and send them to join the community. Success means a visitor understands what Motion Dojo is, who it is for, what they can do inside, what Black Belt in Motion Design and Dojo's AI are, and how to join.

## Positioning

Motion Dojo is a community where motion designers grow together through learning, practice, feedback and shared progress. The central message is "You were never meant to figure it all out alone."

## Operating Context

The site is part of one ecosystem with four identities:

- **Motion Dojo**: the parent brand and community.
- **Black Belt in Motion Design**: the structured course, on its own site (joinmotiondojo.vercel.app). Four phases: Foundations, Tool Mastery, Creative Execution, Portfolio & Mastery.
- **Keyframe Ninjas**: the name for students enrolled in Black Belt. An identity, not a product. Introduced only where students appear.
- **Dojo's AI**: an in-house tool built for community members. Not a course or a separate community.

Joining currently happens through the Black Belt site, where the community manager gives access after payment.

## Capabilities and Constraints

- Next.js 15 (App Router), plain CSS, deployed on Vercel.
- All outbound links live in `src/config/site.ts`; editable content lives in `src/data/content.ts`.
- Dojo's AI URL, features, screenshots and demo are not supplied yet. Do not invent them.
- No dedicated community invite URL yet.
- Contact email and WhatsApp are not supplied yet.

## Brand Commitments

- Palette: Dojo Midnight #140A2E, Motion Violet #6D32E8, Electric Lavender #A77BFF, Kinetic Lime #C8FF3D, White #F7F5FF. Light backgrounds about 80% of the time, Midnight for selected sections, Lime sparingly.
- Type: Clash Display for headings, Sora for text.
- Personality: minimal, editorial, premium, expressive, motion-inspired, modern, community-driven.
- Visual language comes from motion design itself: keyframes, motion paths, timelines, graph-editor curves. The dojo idea shapes the philosophy, not the imagery: no martial-arts clichés, Japanese symbols or samurai graphics.
- Voice: simple, clear, short sentences, no jargon or corporate language. Introduce the benefit before the product or identity name.
- Primary call to action: Join the community.

## Product Principles

1. Belonging first: the page should feel like an invitation to a community, never a checkout.
2. One ecosystem: Motion Dojo is the parent; the course and the tool belong to it.
3. Truth over filler: only real people, real work and real words from the team.
4. Plain words: say what things are and do, for a reader on a phone.

Mobile-first; touch targets of at least 44px; text contrast of at least 4.5:1; body text of at least 16px; respect reduced-motion preferences.
